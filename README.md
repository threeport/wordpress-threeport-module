# WordPress Threeport Module

A reference implementation for extending
[Threeport](https://github.com/threeport/threeport).

This project demonstrates how to use the Threeport SDK to build modules for
Threeport.  See the [Threeport Docs](https://threeport.io/sdk/tutorial/) for a
tutorial that provides step-by-step instructions on how to build this module.

## Quickstart

installed](https://threeport.io/install/install-tptctl/), you can install the
plugin for this WordPress module as follows.

1. Clone this repo.

1. Build the plugin binary.  Requires [mage](https://magefile.org/).
   ```bash
   mage build:plugin
   ```

   ```bash
   cp bin/wordpress ~/.threeport/plugins/
   ```

If you have a local Threeport control plane running, you can install an instance
of Wordpress as follows.

1. Create a local container registry.
   ```bash
   mage dev:localRegistryUp
   ```
